For the hotel strategy, it's a bit more complicated than the flight one.\\
As these auctions are english auction, we thought that we have to put a enough big price to get ou hotel but not to big to not make the price grow too much.\\
So this strategy is based on a variable "delta". This delta is the average ask price changes, each time the auction change, we update the delta by this function: delta= (delta + newAskPrice - oldAskPrice)/2. With the function we can have an overview of what will happen in the future rounds.\\
Each time the quote for the auction is update, we compared the ask price with our bid and then there is 2 possibility:\\
\begin{itemize}
\item The ask price is higher than our bid, in that case we change our bid price for the ask price+delta.
\item The ask price is lower than our bid in that case we change nothing
\end{itemize}
This strategy permits to have a bigger price than the ask price because each time the ask price go over our bid we update it. And it permits to not have a too big price because if our price is higher than the ask price we don't update our bid.\\
Updating with the delta permits to  predict the future growth of the price and allow us to not update our price each time there is a new ask price but just in case we will not have the hotel.
