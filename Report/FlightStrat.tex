For the hotel auction strategy, we've decided to put 2 limits:\\
\begin{itemize}
\item A low limit: if the price of the hotel that we want goes under this limit, we buy it.
\item A high limit: if the price become too high and goes over this limit we buy it too, to prevent a too big spending.
\end{itemize}
At the begining we just put a low limit, but after many tests, we saw that the price usually become really big after some times then, we decided to put a high limit.
In a first step we've put some fixed limits (200 for the low limit and 400 for the high limit) but after thought, we realized that was not really relevant because the prices begin between 250 and 400 so there can be a gap between some auction.\\
So we decided to adapt the limits for each auction. We've put different limits for the each auctions, regarding the starting price of the auction:\\
\begin{itemize}
\item Low limit = Starting price - 10% of the starting price
\item High limit = Starting price + 10% of the starting price
\end{itemize}
This is a better strategy than before because we adapt our price according to each auction and not only a global strat for all the auctions.
