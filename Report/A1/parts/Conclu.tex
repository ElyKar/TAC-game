\section*{Concusion}

In the end, we believe our ideas for the TAC game were decent and worked well, except for the hotel auction.\\
We chose to optimize client satisfaction, however another choice could have been to maximize the final score : difference between client satisfaction and insatisfaction.\\
Furthermore, we provide three other ways to improve our agent, but they are difficult to implement and we prefered to focus on having a less performant, working agent rather than a more performant, buggy agent.
\begin{itemize}
    \item Using a genetic algorithm, we could have had a dynamic optimal state of the game, refreshing at each update in the game (auction closed, bid accepted, auction updated, \dots ). This way, we could ensure an optimal or quasi-optimal set of packages for a reasonable price.
    \item With machine learning over the auctions of the hotels, we might have been able to infer which set of nights did the other agent wanted and go for the other hotel if the competition was too high.
    \item Using Markov chains, it would have been possible to predict the next state of the game according to the current one and react accordingly. However, this is hardest strategy to implement out of the three.
\end{itemize}

Finally, we were pleased to take part in this competition, even though our agent was lacking in some ways.
