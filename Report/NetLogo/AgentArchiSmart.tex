This philosopher is a little bit more smart because he will look at the marks on the forks and will mark the forks that he need. The goal is the same: eat when hungry. But this timethe agent be careful of other agents needs.\\
Despite this difference the architecture for this smart philospoher is the same than the naive: a reactive agent.\\
Because the difference is about the marks on the forks, and the marks are managed by a "if series" too, indeed, if a philospoh has a fork marked and he doesn't have the other fork he will put down the fork because the mark mean that an other philosoph need it.\\
As you can see before it's just manage by many "if", he doesn't think about his environment and how he can reach his goal.
