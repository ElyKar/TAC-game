\section{Conclusion}
This multi-agent system developed for solving the dining philosophers problem aims at maximizing the time the philosophers spent thinking. To do so, each agent communicates with his neighbors in order to cooperate and make the best use of the shared resources. Based on the observations, the naive agents reach a deadlock very fast because they do not take their environment into account. The smart agent use the environment informations in order to get to their goals, thus reaching a solution of the problem.
