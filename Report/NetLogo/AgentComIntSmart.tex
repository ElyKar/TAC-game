This kind of philosopher is more interesting because smart philosopher are supposed to cooperate to help each other to reach their goal: eat and think.\\
Here there is a communication between philosopher because they mark a fork, that means they want this fork and if a philosopher have a marked fork but doesn't have the other one he will release this fork because someone else need it.\\
It's a kind of communication not directly but by the forks, they send informations to each other marking forks they need.\\
The interaction  between philosopher is the same that the naive agent.
