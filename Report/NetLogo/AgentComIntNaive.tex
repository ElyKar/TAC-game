For the naive version of the agent, the communication is not really advanced because the philospohers don't communicate between them. One philospoh will just communicate with the fork, he will just look if they are available or not. And the interaction is not really complicated neither because a philosopher can just take or release forks. If we want to find a little part of interaction between philosopher it's that if a philosopher have 2 forks another one can't have his 2 forks.\\
So for the naive version there is no lot of interaction and communication.
